# UNO-Victim
A clone of UNO that host a LAN multiplayer option using Java and JavaFX.

We would be creating a remix of UNO with some tweaks to the cards and rules that uses java APIs and JavaFX. This would be hosted on a local IP server that can be played with a group of people ranging from 3-8 and will be determined in the future if AI bots will be included.
